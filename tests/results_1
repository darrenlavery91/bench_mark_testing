Issue:
Overflow: when the CPU falls behind on processing frames the decoder dumps the frames as they are no longer real time.


Memory Performance: Host-05 is generally faster in more complex memory benchmark tests (4 threads), 
but Host-06 performs slightly better in intermediate tests.

Stress Performance: Host-06 shows better results in the basic and intermediate stress tests, 
with higher bogo ops per second.

Huge Pages: Host-05 has more anon huge pages, 
which might give it an advantage in handling large memory pages.
